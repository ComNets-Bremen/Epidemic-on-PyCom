##Evaluation Scenarios
The performance of this implementation has been tested with multiple
indoor and outdoor scenarios in several stages for finding out the base requirements and for step-wise improvements of the project.
**Preliminary test:** to identify the communication methods and mode of the devices
**Range test:** to identify the range of the devices both outdoor and indoor
**Initial evaluation:** to determine the parameter values like cache and queue sizes, amounts of bytes to be sent and received etc.
